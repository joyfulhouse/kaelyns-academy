/**
 * Account-mode rewards state. Guest mode (null learnerId or signedIn:false)
 * yields state:null and the UI hides the economy entirely (spec §3.7).
 *
 * `getRewardsStateAction` swallows transient failures into a signedIn:false
 * shape, which this hook maps to `state:null` — indistinguishable from "still
 * loading" unless callers also check `settled`. `settled` flips true once the
 * in-flight fetch resolves (success or swallowed failure), so a caller can
 * tell "loading" (`!settled`) apart from "fetch failed, offer retry"
 * (`settled && !state`), instead of dead-ending on a spinner forever.
 *
 * The exposed `state`/`settled` are DERIVED against `settledFor` (which
 * learnerId the last resolved fetch belongs to), rather than reset via a
 * synchronous `setState` in the mount/dependency effect — same idiom as
 * useLearnerState's `loadedKey`. That keeps every setState call inside the
 * fetch's `.then` (an async boundary), satisfying
 * `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`, while still enforcing "no learner → no
 * state" the instant `learnerId` goes null and resetting `settled` the
 * instant `learnerId` changes to a different learner — both take effect on
 * the very next render, no extra effect tick needed.
